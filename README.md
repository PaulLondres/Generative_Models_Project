# Generative Models Project

This repository contains the data and code for the Generative Models project, part of the second semester of the MVA program.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and study the method proposed in https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11793. 
We also wanted to compare it with a conditionnal diffusion model, train specifically for deblurring.

## Directory Structure

- `data/`: Contains the datasets used for training and evaluating the generative models.
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the project divided in half, one for the conditionnal and one for the unconditionnal model
